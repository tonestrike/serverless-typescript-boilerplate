* Elias Junior - used [the code from his article](https://medium.com/@eliasjcjunior/create-serverless-application-with-express-and-typescript-a4c0c25060b2) as a jumping off point. The Github links in that article were no longer valid.
* Serverless - [this blog post](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-express-rest-api) was helpful in undersatnding how to add a DynamoDB to the YAML definition and setup a local instance of DynamoDB to run with `serverless-offline`
